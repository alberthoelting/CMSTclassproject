<h1>A brief history of the Shawnee Hoeltings</h1>
<p>&nbsp;Albert Frank Hoelting was born in St. Louis, Missouri to a family of thirteen children. He lived a normal childhood for the time period, but when he reached adulthood, he needed to make a major decision. One that would change his life and give his children a better life than his own. Albert Frank was not the oldest child, therefore he did not have the ability to sit around and wait to receive his inheritance, so like many other young men at the time, he left home in search of work. He traveled west with his wife, son, and their camper trailer. In 1943, he was able a to get a job at the Sunflower Ammunition Plant, just west of what is now the Greater Kansas City area.
<br><br>
&nbsp;During his time working at the plant, he also built up an avid reputation as a cook, earning him the nickname "Cook." Eventually he was able to save up enough money to purchase a lot in Desoto, Kansas and build a house for his growing family. This would prove to be a major turning point for Cook, because he now had friends and other community members asking him to build houses for their families. But he wouldn't truly get his foot in the door until the end of the war, with the massive influx of returning GIs. These returning soldiers needed housing so they could live near family and have a place to live when they are able to get a job. This is where Albert Frank really begins to build a name in the world of home builders. He starts building countless homes in the Mission, Fairway, and Prairie Village areas of Kansas. These homes were small "cracker-box" style homes usually consisting of two bedrooms and a bathroom. By todays standards these houses seem small, but they were all that was wanted and needed in the time period. 
<br><br>
When the late 50's came around, he needed to build a bigger house to support his family which was steadily growing until it reached 11 children. This is when he finds the Shawnee area. Cook begins building larger and larger houses trying to keep up with growing demand and cements his legacy as a founder of the Shawnee area, as well as the others previously listed. Many of his 11 children would follow in his footsteps and continue building the city of shawnee and many of the neighboring cities.</p>
